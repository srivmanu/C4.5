Implementation of c4.5
Data format needed :
names file : 
classes should be mentioned in first line. 
attributes should be mentioned one per line, with type of data separated with a colon, eg.
	attrbute : (d1,d2,d3)
OR	
	attribute : continuous

data file : 
class should be the first OR last attribute.

How to run : 

> python main.py [data-file-name] [names-file-name]

eg. 
> python main.py "../data/house-votes-84/house-votes-84.data" "../data/house-votes-84/house-votes-84.names"

Expected Output : 

sepal length <= 2.45 :
        sepal width <= 6.8 :
                petal width <= 4.15 :
                        petal length <= 7.8 : Iris-setosa
                        petal length > 7.8 : Iris-virginica
                petal width > 4.15 : Iris-setosa
        sepal width > 6.8 : Iris-virginica
sepal length > 2.45 : Iris-virginica

The code creates the tree based on 80% of random rows selected from data. (training)

The testing can be done on the remaining 20% of the data by uncommenting line 17 of main.py 

(at 3:38 AM 19 Feb, Testing only works for discrete data. Figuring out how to test for continuous data.)
(UPDATE 4:26 AM 19 Feb, Testing works on continuous data as well.)
